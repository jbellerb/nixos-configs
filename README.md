# nixos-configs

This flake contains the NixOS config of my media server as well as my in-progress ports and modules. Since mid-2019 and through multiple hardware changes (including the upgrade to 64-bit), some version of this config has supported my server needs. Flakeification of all the things happened in early 2022. I'll try to keep this current with my true config, but the two will differ until I figure out what to do with private info. Secrets are managed with [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix).
